        As an employee the idea of beeing monitored is a very worrying idea. It feels as if your employer is going to be always watching, but at the most basic form
        a supervisor or a manager is monitoring an employee. So if no matter what an employer is going to monitor their employees what should be consider to much.
        How many cameras are too many? Is there areas where having cameras crossing a line? Are there other forms of monitoring that are good or bad?
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5">
        ...This may seem like as an employee there is mainly negatives to be assoicated with being monitored. And in a lot of cases there can be, but it can
        also be used to protect you in some cases. Such as cameras monitoring you when a mistake happens that is out of your control happens. Then there will be
        a hard copy of what happened to protect you.

        With all that being said on the more "ethical" side of being monitored by an employer. You should also be aware of your legal rights, and what
        actions can be taken if those rights are "infringed" upon. 
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5">
        First off, in the United States the federal government has some regulations in place dictating regulations for employee monitoring. One such being the Electronic Communications 
        Privacy Act of 1986(ECPA); Under the ECPA a business can monitor all verbal and written communiocation that it can present as being legitamate to the business. It also states that 
        employees may give consent to allow for addtional monitoring. When it comes to video surveliance it has to be within reason. While additional measures vary state by state 
        for the most part they only require the buisness to make an employee aware that they are being monitored.

          you should expect that everything you do is going to be logged and storred. You should also be aware that
