      <h3 class="text-center">Introduction</h3>
      <p class="fs-5 text-center">
        As an employee the idea of beeing monitored is a very worrying idea. It feels as if your employer is going to be always watching, but at the most basic form
        a supervisor or a manager is monitoring an employee. So if no matter what an employer is going to monitor their employees what should be consider to much.
        How many cameras are too many? Is there areas where having cameras crossing a line? Are there other forms of monitoring that are good or bad?
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5 text-center">
        ...This may seem like as an employee there is mainly negatives to be assoicated with being monitored. And in a lot of cases there can be, but it can
        also be used to protect you in some cases. Such as cameras monitoring you when a mistake happens that is out of your control happens. Then there will be
        a hard copy of what happened to protect you.

        <h3 class="text-center">Laws and Regulations</h3>
        <p class="fs-5 text-center">
          With all that being said on the more "ethical" side of being monitored by an employer. You should also be aware of your legal rights, and what
          actions can be taken if those rights are "infringed" upon. 
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5 text-center">
          First off, in the United States the federal government has some regulations in place dictating regulations for employee monitoring. One such being the Electronic Communications 
          Privacy Act of 1986(ECPA); Under the ECPA a business can monitor all verbal and written communiocation that it can present as being legitamate to the business. It also states that 
          employees may give consent to allow for addtional monitoring. When it comes to video surveliance it has to be within reason. While additional measures vary state by state 
          for the most part they only require the buisness to make an employee aware that they are being monitored.

      <h3 class="text-center">Benefits and Negatives</h3>
        <p class="fs-5 text-center">
          There are many negatives to employee monitoring. One of which is when it comes to be detrimental to the function of your work. Such as the feeling that you are being watched to closely. 
          This can cause stress and make it harder to focus on the actual task at hand. 
        <p class="fs-5 text-center">
          There are some benefits to being monitored, they do require you to do your job properly and actively, but for most people they feel as if they do not outweigh the negatives. One such of these benefits is 
          that any issues or problems that may arise will more likely be properly documented or seen by visual surveliance, so if an employee was doing there job properly they are more proteced from 
          false retaliation from their employer.

      <h3 class="text-center">In Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="fs-5 text-center">
          As an employee you have very few rights to privacy while on the job. This goes from being survelied and having your computer usage monitored. When using company property 
          you should expect that everything you do is going to be logged and stored.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5 text-center">
         With this said not every part of employee monitoring is a negative and their is some benefits to it, and you should be aware of these benefits and negatives. While most 
         employees do not want to be monitored it is going to be a part of their work lives. It just depends on how their employer implements it and how that affects your 
         abilty to work.
