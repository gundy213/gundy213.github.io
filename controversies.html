      <p class="fs-5">
        Although surveillance in the workplace is quite common, especially due to the rise of at home workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that does not 
        mean it is excluded from having a variety of opinions based around it and how it should be carried out. Make sure to check out the 
        <a href ="employer-considerations.html">Employer Considerations</a> page to learn more about some reasons employers may implement workplace surveillance.
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5">
        There are three main scenarios that become controversial when it comes to employee monitoring: where monitoring should begin and end, where that information 
        is required, and where the monitoring impacts the effectiveness of employees and the trust between employers and employees. However, monitoring 
        employees can sometimes improve productivity, protect the company secrets and provide evidence to protect companies against legal liability.

        <h3 class="text-center">Benificial Aspects</h3>
        <p class="fs-5 ">
          There are quite a few benefits for employers in the sense of employee monitoring. For example, the business may benefit by being better able to prevent theft, 
          protection of intellectual property, improved decision-making for managers and other leaders, and aide in protecting against legal liability through providing 
          evidence in various legal disputes. 
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">
          Workers can also benefit from being monitored by their employers. When it is used appropriately, surveillance may protect employees from multiple types of false 
          accusations. Some employees may even use surveillance capabilities to obtain information on their employers to expose violations and facilitate collective bargaining.

      <h3 class="text-center">Negative Aspects</h3>
        <p class="fs-5">
          However, there are also some key drawbacks regarding employee monitoring especially when it comes to its impacts on employees' privacy, its impacts on the trust 
          relationship between employees and employers, and the incentives it creates. When used inappropriately, employee surveillance can be perceived as an infringement 
          on privacy, specifically when employees did not previously consent to the collection of their data. This in turn causes major amounts of mutual trust and confidence 
          lost between the employer and their employee.

      <h3 class="text-center">Other Considerations</h3>
        <p class="fs-5">
          There have even been studies regarding employee monitoring and the health effects it has on employees. Some workers have reported higher levels of stress and low morale 
          due to the pressure to perform. This can eventually cause attrition of good employees. Morally speaking, the right to privacy should not be violated so easily without 
          strong justification, but there is still the problem of power imbalance. This imbalance between employers and employees creates an economic coercion that may force 
          employees to consent to surveillance to retain their positions. Overt surveillance has sometimes led to resistance from workers. This can take multiple forms. For example, 
          subverting surveillance measures through leaving phone lines open for long periods of time after they are no longer being used.

      <h3 class="text-center">In Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="fs-5">
          Luckily, there have been multiple federal protections against workplace surveillance. However, these are limited and ineffectual.
          The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, for example, has a business exception allowing employers to monitor communications
          for legitimate business reasons, and the "consent exception" allowing monitoring of communications where employees consent. This has 
          allowed plenty of room for businesses to maneuver around the rules to excessively monitor their employees. States have also pushed for 
          various protection laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, Colorado's SB 21-190, and the Virginia Consumer Data 
          Protection Act. All these protection laws are being enacted to ensure that data that is collected by businesses on individuals must be 
          disclosed if requested. This also includes their own employees. However, disclosure of information alone is not sufficient enough to protect 
          against overzealous surveillance.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">
          Ultimately, the best solution would be collective bargaining between employers and employees. This can be used as a tool to create
          worker-friendly protections that may counteract detrimental impacts of surveillance in the workplace. Therefore, many 
          legislators and regulators should seek to strengthen collective bargaining rights. This can be done by facilitating unionization
          to allow the unions to mandate negotiations for workers and increasing both the employees' and unions' awareness of their rights to 
          negotiate surveillance policies.
