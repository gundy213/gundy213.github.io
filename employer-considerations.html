      <p class="fs-5">
        Many employers may decide to implement employee monitoring without considering many factors. Sometimes this can lead to many issues in the work place. 
        Some best practices when implementing employee monitoring are: determine why you want to monitor your employees, check legal requirments and regulations, 
        create a policy, do not be invasive, communicate to your employees and listen to them.
      </p>
      <p class="fs-5">
        When you are beginning a new system to monitor your employees, you need to start by outlining why you are beginning to monitor your employees. Some 
        employers wish to track the productivity of their workers, while others are more interested in tracking the attendance of their employees. It is 
        crucial to determine what your needs are in regards to employee monitoring so you are able to choose the right tools and software you may need.

        <h3 class="text-center">Laws and Regulations</h3>
        <p class="fs-5 ">
        Another important part to double check before establishing a monitoring system is checking with your local requirements and regulations. For example, 
        while it may be legal to not notify employees of their monitoring in the United States, it is illegal to do so without the employees conset in the European 
        Union. There may also be things that are completely ilegal such as tracking key strokes or capturing screenshots. You will want to check with these regulations 
        to make sure you are following them correctly.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">
        In addition, you will want to create a clear and detailed monitoring policy. This should communicate to your workers what the monitoring system will look like, 
        how it will work, and how you will protect their privacy and security. This way all employees (both low and high level) will know what is to be expected of them 
        and what to expect from the system. It also creates more comfort among employees that they are not being secretly spied on. It may also may ease employees to 
        always gain their consent and acknowledgment to being monitored.

    <div class="col-lg">
      <h3 class="text-center">Respecting Privacy</h3>
        <p class="fs-5">
          Next, you will want to remember to not be invasive. This is the golden rule to having a successful employee monitoring system. Basically, you should only monitor and 
        track the things that will help with acheiving the goals you should have previously defined. Beyond that you should not take advantage of your monitoring system to watch 
        and track your employees. By being less invasive, employees will be more at ease at the idea of having a monitoring system implemented into the workplace. A couple things 
        to avoid would be recording or tracking personal emails or instant messages that might be sent or received or even recording keystrokes.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">
          Now, before you fully install your monitoring system, you should take some time to sit down with your employees and not only communicate everything regarding the system, 
        but also listen to their thoughts and opinions regarding this system. It would also be beneficial to set up a trial time period to test your system. This way your employees 
        are able to give feedback and adjust to the new system.

      <h3 class="text-center">In Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="fs-5">
          If you follow all these considerations and options while implementing your new employee monitoring system it will make the transition quite smoothe. It will also help releive 
          any stress employees may have with the idea of being monitored. It will also make their transition smoother and help them let go of any of their restraints regarding the new system.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-5">
          Be careful when implementing your employee monitoring system. It can be a very powerful tool for employers to use to track their goals and make changes to their systems to 
          acheive their goals. However, this tool can be very easily abused and taken advantage of. Should you allow this to happen you may lose some employees, or create unease and 
          frustration among the work force.
